# Choose a framework to use for coursework 1

Completing the activities should have given you a basic introduction to each of the frameworks that
can be used for coursework 1. This is unlikely to be enough for you to make an informed choice
of which to use for your coursework.

Please spend some time carrying out your own research to help you decide which framework may be best
suited to your app.

You designed an app in COMP0035 coursework 2. This is the app you will be developing (you can modify
it, you are not expected to develop it exactly as you designed it, nor are you expected to develop
all of it).

Some general links to get you started, but please also find your own sources. When you search,
consider the specific needs of your app and what you would like to learn e.g.

Is it mostly charts/dashboard?

Do you have an ML model you want to deploy?

Does your 'feature' require a third-party library?

Are you attempting to integrate chatbot functionality?

Do you want to learn a particular web app framework as it might be useful for your other courses or
employment?

Do you want to learn some HTML and CSS, or just Python?

Do you want a more mature framework that offers good documentation and support? Or are you more
interested in a newer framework?

## Coursework 1

Front end app with charts plus some other functionality of your choice

**Options: Flask, Streamlit, Dash**

Examples of apps built with Flask, Streamlit and Dash:

- [Dash examples](https://plotly.com/examples/?utm_source=dash_docs&utm_medium=documentation&utm_content=header&_gl=1*10rinoc*_gcl_au*MTA5NTk2Njg1NC4xNzYzMTMxNzY0*_ga*MTQzOTY4MzE1NC4xNzYzMTMxNzY0*_ga_6G7EE0JNSC*czE3Njc5NTYzNDMkbzYkZzEkdDE3Njc5NjAyNDEkajU3JGwwJGgw)
- [Streamlit examples](https://streamlit.io/gallery)

Flask does not have a hosted gallery of apps as the other two frameworks do. There are many examples
freely available, but in all cases you have to download the code and run it yourself to see what the
app does. The following link is from a hackathon which shows still images from the created sites.

## Coursework 2

Backend REST API that accesses the database

**Options: FastAPI, Flask**

You do not need to decide this now, though understanding the options could influence your choice for
coursework 1. Teaching will focus on FastAPI.
